elcome to CMA Reservations Reports for Drupal 7.x

This module upon installation will create a view, cma_reservations_reports, with
3 displays:

1. Reservation Breakdown by Hours
   This report can be used to get a sense of your daily traffic.     
   It has a custom header that will show reservations broken down by hours 
   within a day that can be filtered by a number of filters. The raw data
   is presented beneath the filters.


2. Reservation Usage Counts
   This report can be used to glean insight regarding inventory type usage.
   It has a custom header that shows inventory reservations counts for number
   of uses, hours of use, and dollar value of use grouped by inventory type
   groupings. It can be filtered by date, reservation status, reservation type
   (bucket/resource), inventory type groupings, or inventory type.

3. Reservation Usage Percentage
   This report can be used to understand how often specific inventory items
   are being used.
   It has a custom header that shows percentage of reservation usage by
   inventory item based on the number of hours an item was used out of 
   the hours it was available to be reserved. 

This module also provides a menu page: admin/airings/manage/reports that has links to both the Distribution Report and the Refresh Show Runtimes page.
