Commits:
  dde1884 - 3908: fix so user can filter on inventory items reservations tab view
  
Includes:
  - Fixes related reservations_ui:reservations_ui_node_res filter
    - Launch List
      - Revert Reservations UI: Node Reservation to use code instead of DB
    - Issue: the user was unable to submit the Start Date filter on the 
      Reservations tab of inventory items 
      - two start date filters were set and were conflicting
    - Issue: Each time the filter is submitted, the page returns to the View tab.
      - Menu item was being added for the view which was using a master 
        display. Added a page with a tab menu and removed code for menu and 
        callback
      - add a hook to alter the tabs for nonreservable content types so that
        the view is only shown on reservable content types

7.x-3.1, 2021 FEB 25
--------------------
commits:
  #2865 - don't allow changing reservation dates and assigning items in a single operation.
  https://bitbucket.org/openflows/generic.res.openflows.com/commits/2c259c4a8626d73f0bd3cd8dbf87f5817742711f
Includes:
- New Validation Rule:
  The user is not allowed to check out items or assign them if they also changed the start or end date.
  This is because the validation of assigned items only checks if the reservation conflicts with other assigned items.
  This validation ignores unassigned reservation and if allowed a user can make an item unavailable to another existing
  order by assigning and changing the date at the same time.


7.x-3.0, 2021 FEB 25
