This SOAP service includes both a client, and server. The Drupal module serves as the client, 
while the server is defined by everything in the "server" folder.

BASIC INSTALLATION STEPS:
1. Copy the entire server folder to your remote server, somewhere publically accessible
2. In order for logging to work, make sure the permissions on the server directory allow the
   apache user write access.
3. Test that internet_archive_server.php is accessible by visiting it in your web browser, for 
   instance if you placed it at the root of your server you would visit:
   http://www.myserver.com/server/internet_archive_server.php
4. You should get a blank screen when you visit that page -- if you receive an error about
   your PHP version or CURL, you will need to lookup instructions for your distribution to
   get them resolved before moving forward.
5. Open up internet_archive_server.wsdl on your remote server, and edit the 4th to last line that
   looks like: <soap:address location='http://www.yourserver.com/server/internet_archive_server.php'/>
   Change the address to reflect your remote server's address, for example:
   <soap:address location='http://www.pegstationx.com/server/internet_archive_server.php'/>
6. Open up internet_archive_server.php on your remote server, and edit the Token line to
   something unique. For instance in define("TOKEN", "your-token-here");, replace
   "your-token-here" with a random string of characters and numbers like(but not): k34289ufjs8923
   Note this token for later, as you will need to enter it in the module config shortly.
7. Back in your Drupal installation, enable the Internet Archive Remote server module
8. Visit admin/settings/internet_archive/remote and fill out the required fields
9. If everything is correct, you should get a "Connection Test: Passed" message at the top

OTHER IMPORTANT NOTES:
The SoapService depends on PHP timeout settings. On both the client and server, you should set all
of the following to infinite or fairly high values:
max_execution_time
max_input_time
default_socket_timeout

The requirements for the amount of time will depend on your internet connection and the size of files
you are moving between your server/Archive.org. An example from one station transferring broadcast mpegs (2-8gb):
max_execution_time 3000
max_input_time 3000
default_socket_timeout 1200
