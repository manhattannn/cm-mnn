<h2>Installation</h2>
<ol>
  <li>Make sure you have <a href="http://curl.haxx.se/">CURL</a> installed on your server. Many servers come with it already installed, and for those that don't there is typically an easy command to install it. For instance on Ubuntu, from the command line it should be as easy as "apt-get install php5-curl".</li>
  <li>Install the internet archive module directory under sites/all/modules or sites/yoursite/modules</li>
  <li>Enable the module at <a href="/admin/build/modules">admin > build > modules</a></li>
</ol>
<h2>Basic Configuration</h2>
<ol>
  <li>If you do not already have an account on <a href="http://www.archive.org/account/login.createaccount.php">archive.org, create one</a></li>
  <li>If you do not already have an S3 key on archive.org, visit 
   <a href="http://www.archive.org/account/s3.php">http://www.archive.org/account/s3.php</a> while logged in to your archive.org account.</li>
  <li> Visit the internet archive settings page at: 
   <a href="/admin/settings/internet_archive">admin > site configuration > internet archive</a></li>
  <li>Choose a unique default item name to test your connection with (it can be changed at any time, and can be overridden using the "Use node title for item name" or with a module implementing hook_metadata. Item names must consist only of alphanumeric characters (dashes are ok as well). For testing purposes, it is important that this item be unique -- you can check if an item exists by visiting http://www.archive.org/details/itemnamehere</li>
  <li>Enter your S3 Access & Secret keys from step #2</li>
  <li>Save the configuration, you should get a "tested successfully" message, if not please check that your account credentials are correct. If the problem persists, check the "Enable Debug Mode" box on the settings form and then check the watchdog for any obvious issues / where applicable report issues to the issue queue at <a href="http://drupal.org/project/internet_archive">http://drupal.org/project/internet_archive</a></li>
</ol>
<h2>Using with a Content Type / Field</h2>
<ol>
  <li>Add a filefield, textfield or custom emfield to your content type if not already in place. If using a textfield or emfield, it must contain a local path to the files you wish to send to archive.org, example: sites/default/files/botp-cc.mov, unless you have configured the internet_archive_remote module</li>
  <li>Go to <a href="/admin/settings/internet_archive">admin > site configuration > internet archive</a></li>
  <li>Under "Field Integration" select the fields you wish to be able to integrate with archive.org.</li>
  <li>To test, visit a node containing one of the fields you enabled -- you should now see a "Transfer to Archive.org" option beneath the file path listing (if you have custom theming or have removed the field from display this option will not be available. For testing purposes I suggest you change the theme on your admin account temporarily to garland / enable display of the field). Clicking this link will send the associated file to your default item on archive.org (unless you have implemented hook_metadata or checked "Use node title for item name", in which case it will go to a new item).</li>
  <li>If you are storing video files, you can configure your field to display as an archive.org video embed in CCK/views</li>
</ol>

<h2>Using the Automated Queue</h2>
<ol>
  <li>Download/configure/enable <a href="http://www.drupal.org/project/drupal_queue">http://www.drupal.org/project/drupal_queue</a> following the included README.txt</li>
  <li>Download/enable http://www.drupal.org/project/views</li>
  <li>Create a view that includes file path as one of the fields.</li>
  <li>Visit <a href="/admin/settings/internet_archive">admin > site configuration > internet archive</a></li>
  <li>Click on the Queue Settings tab</li>
  <li>Select your view/s, add any time configuration settings</li>
  <li>You can test out your new queue by visiting the queue monitor page at <a href="/admin/build/internet_archive">admin/build/internet_archive</a></li>
  <li>By default, drupal_queue will harvest and transfer files on cron run. If you would prefer to separate the transfer process from Drupal's standard cron, set the variable 'drupal_queue_on_cron' to FALSE. You can then choose to either run drupal_queue's cron via the file and instructions included in that module, or using Drush. If Drush is installed, files can be harvested/transferred via the "drush ia-transfer" command. In all cases the module will only queue up unique files based on their origin path to prevent duplicates.</li>
